# Chat with PDFs: Free AI-Powered App Using Google Gemini and Streamlit

Welcome to **Chat with PDFs**, a **free AI-powered application** that lets you interact directly with the content of your PDF documents. By leveraging the power of **Google Gemini LLM**, **Chroma**, and **Streamlit**, this app offers an easy and efficient way to query information from PDFs. The app is completely free to use, utilizing state-of-the-art **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** technology to ensure accurate and contextually relevant answers.

## üåü **Why Chat with PDFs?**

With the increasing need for managing documents and extracting knowledge from PDFs, finding the right information quickly can be challenging. This AI-powered app is designed to:

+ **Save Time**: Instead of scanning through long documents, simply ask questions and receive direct answers.
+ **Enhance Productivity**: Ideal for researchers, students, or professionals who deal with large amounts of data.
+ **Accessible and Free**: Completely free to use, with a friendly user interface.

## üõ† **Technologies Used**

This project is built using the following technologies:

+ **Google Gemini Model**:
  - **Embedding model**: For accurate document representation.
  - **Chat model**: To generate conversational responses based on the PDF content.

+ **Chroma**: Used as the vector database for efficient and scalable content retrieval.

+ **Streamlit**: The simple and interactive **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for users to interact with the app.

+ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: For combining relevant document retrieval and LLM responses.

## üìñ **How It Works**

The app works by extracting and embedding the content of your PDF into a vector database using **Google Gemini embeddings**. When you ask a question, the app searches through the embedded content, retrieves the relevant information using **Chroma**, and generates an accurate response via the **Google Gemini chat model**.

Here's a breakdown of the process:
+ **Step 1**: Upload a PDF file.
+ **Step 2**: The app extracts and embeds the content.
+ **Step 3**: Ask a question in the chat interface.
+ **Step 4**: The app retrieves the relevant data from the PDF and generates an answer using the Google Gemini chat model.
